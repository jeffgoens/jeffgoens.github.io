## Q & A
### What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
There isn't just one thing that held me back this week, but a couple:
  1. In-Person Bootcamp: Being in person is a better learning environment than being Remote. However, I found myself mentally drained at the end of the day. Not wanting to do any "computer" work once I get home. After basically spending the entire day in front of a computer, my eyes and my brain need to take a mcuh needed rest. 
  2. JavaScript: I feel as though I still struggle with just grasping the basic concepts of JavaScript. When I look back at the way I coded the Mind Reader project, I was able to complete the project, it worked and I understood what I did. But the approach was much simplier than others. 
  3. JSON Sprint 1 assignment: Not recognizing I needed to complete the slide Basic JavaScript 1 (Objects. JSON) more than likely contributed to a lack of understanding this week. After the in-person learning session about State, the slide decks were released and I assumed it was the material we had just covered in person.


### What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
Considering I completely overlooked the JSON / Data Structures / Objects material, I definitely need to go back and revisit these items.

### How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?
For me, In-Person Bootcamp is a better environment to learn. While I work well on my own and do not need motivation from a teacher or instructor to complete my  assignments, it's just easier to learn in a classroom setting. If there's a concept or idea I don't understand, I can ask and get an immediate answer. Plus, it's encouraging to see that I'm not the only person who struggles with this journey.


### What is your "Why"?
It's rewarding to put yourself in a position where the outcome rest solely on your shoulders. Leaving a job and starting over in a completely new direction is a risk, and considering my age, it's one that I didn't take lightly. But I wanted to prove to myself that regardless of your age, and regardless of your background, one can make a change in the direction of their life. And whether the outcome is a success or a failure, it rest on me.
