## Q & A
### What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
There isn't just one thing that held me back this week, but a couple:
  1. In-Person Bootcamp: Being in person is a better learning environment than being Remote. However, I found myself mentally drained at the end of the day. Not wanting to do any "computer" work once I get home. After basically spending the entire day in front of a computer, my eyes and my brain need to take a mcuh needed rest. 
  2. JavaScript: I feel as though I still struggle with just grasping the basic concepts of JavaScript. When I look back at the way I coded the Mind Reader project, I was able to complete the project, it worked and I understood what I did. But the approach was much simplier than others. 
  3. JSON Sprint 1 assignment: Not recognizing I needed to complete the slide Basic JavaScript 1 (Objects. JSON) more than likely contributed to a lack of understanding this week. After the in-person learning session about State, the slide decks were released and I assumed it was the material we had just covered in person.
