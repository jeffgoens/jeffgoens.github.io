## Q & A
### What are your thought about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
- These three are used to format, design, and program web pages. With each playing a key role to increase user interaction. For me, how pleasing to the eye is what initially draws me to a page, i.e., is it too busy on the eye when reading, are color schemes not balanced, etc. Regardless what Javascript functionality the page may offer, if it isn't visually "friendly", I'll search for another source. Ultimately I may have to return and use the page due to a function it offers, but initially I look at the visual appeal. 

### What are some objects that your blog incorporates?
 - At this point in my coding journey, my blog is rather simplistic and straightforward. Offering only the basics in an easy to read format, and incorporating a hyperlink for each blog week. There are no eye popping graphics, backgrounds or color schemes. 

### What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?
 - After completing the project, I can easily see how important pseudocoding is and the role it plays. Providing the blueprint that helps you plan out the steps needed to tackle a project.
