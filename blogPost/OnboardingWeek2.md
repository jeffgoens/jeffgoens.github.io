## Q & A
### What is something yo wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?
- The ability to create a complete HTML/CSS/JavaScript page without having to Google all of the material, especially the Javascript. While I know the basic tags and styling rules, I've only scratched the surface with JavsScript.

### What are you struggling with?
- `git` commands within GitPod. 
- JavaScript / DOM and how to correlate it with HTML.
- Time management - which leads to completing the minimum requirements each week for demo day.

### How do you solve a problem?
- Considering my automotive background, it's hard not use TPS when I look at a problem. I don't use the entire 8 Step Toyota Way, only the basic steps. Applying these concepts to coding issues may look a little different, but the basic concepts are the same:
    - Clarify the Problem - what is happening vs. what should be happening. The difference between the two is your problem.
    - Breakdown the Problem / Root Cause - what you believe to be the problem may not be the actual root cause. Use 5 Why method to find the actual issue.
    - Develop and Implement Countermeasures
    - Monitor the Results - did the fix or countermeasure address the issue.

### What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
- To help myself get unstuck on coding issues, I usually take one of the following approaches:
    - Retrace my steps through the code, maybe the code isn't working because I forot something simple. Did I overlook a step in the process, did I forget a closing bracket, is a variable misspelled, etc.
    - Use resources to find the solution - Google, MDN, W3schools.
    - Take a step back and completely remove myself from the computer. Could be taking the dogs for a walk or going out in the yard and pulling weeds. Using this time to breath in some fresh air and clear my thoughts.
