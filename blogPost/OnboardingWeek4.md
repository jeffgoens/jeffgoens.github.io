## Q & A
### What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?
- I'm going to break this down into two categories: *internal* and *external*.
    - Internal - items that were directly related to Awesome Inc.
      - Slack - Being able to communicate at an instant in the various channels was extremely helpful. Questions or topics were often asked in the various channels that were related to an issue I was currently dealing with or needed help with. Very useful tool.
      - Zoom - Not only was this used to follow our daily progress and to communicate daily activities, but it also was a valuable tool to get to know your teammates. You could see the progression from week to week of how people would open up and speak about an issue they were having, to offer advice or simply talk to one another.
      - Pre-release of Sprint - Crucial for me was having the next weeks material posted the weekend prior. Completing Onboarding would have been more difficult if this had not happened.
    - External - items that were not related to Awesome Inc.
      - Supportive Spouse - Have to give a shout out to my wife for being so supportive in this endeavor. Onboarding takes so much of your time, I can't imaging how difficult it would be to complete this process without a supporting spouse. Especially when you have to quit your job. 
      - Supportive Employer - Attending the daily Zoom meeting required me to leave my job early. Not only was my employer flexible to allow this, they did not raise an issue with it. Yes, I was going to eventually quit my job, but they could have made this transition much more difficult. And they didn't.



### What hindered your progress during Onboarding?
- The main hinderance was time. Continuing to work a full-time job through the Onboarding process was not easy. My time was basically split three ways: Job, Onboarding and Family/Home. If I had not taken the Intro to Web class, or the Sprints not released early, I'm not certain I would have completed this first phase.

### How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?
- Utilizing the weekend to frontload the next weeks material was the primary way I overcame challenges during the Onboarding process. I could use the weekend to read the many articles required to gain an understanding, and then use the week to research further any concepts I didn't fully understand.
