## Week 1 ##
### *8-26-22* ###

### Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not? ###
- Did not know what to expect for the Onboarding process. Kept an open mind regarding how it would flow, especially since it's remote.
- Expectations have been exceeded regarding class structure:
  - Very well organized
  - Excellent communication and follow-up from the instructors/coaches
  - Everyone eager to learn
- Sprint work pace is faster than I had hoped. Hopeully this is because we received the Sprint 1 material later than usual.



### What are you excited or eager to learn more about? ###
- Eager to learn more about all of the "Gits". Getting a firm foundation on how to use them and how they are related is crucial.
- Excited to see the progression from week to week. Am I learning?



### What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog? ###
- I've worked the past 33 years in the automotive industry. Very eager to start a new direction in life.
- Huge SEC football fan. Can you guess which team...Roll Tide!!
- Can drive an M1 Abrams tank if needed.

### *8-28-22* ###

### Retro ###
- Sprint 1 Goals - Become familiar with Git, GitPod and GitHub
  - After reviewing the *Measure/Retro* class assignment, realized I had overlooked the entire section of Git and GitPod. Was so focused on completing the GitHub assignment, I never went back and read the remaining section that pertained to Git and GitPod. No wonder everyone was referencing these tools and I was in the dark. Definetly a **"duh"** moment.
